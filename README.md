# init.vim

This repository contains my personal N/Vim configuration. With this configuration, I've tailored my favorite text editor to fit my workflow and specific needs.

## What's Included in this Configuration ?

My personal Vim configuration includes:

* My customized `init.vim` file with the configuration options I've chosen for Nvim.
* A plugin folder with the plugins I use to extend Vim's functionality.
* A README.md file that explains how to install and use my personal Vim configuration.
