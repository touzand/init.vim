# init.vim

This repository contains my personal N/Vim configuration. With this configuration, I've tailored my favorite text editor to fit my workflow and specific needs.

## What's Included in this Configuration ?

My personal Vim configuration includes:

* My customized `init.vim` file with the configuration options I've chosen for Nvim.
* A `plugins.vim` file with the plugins I use to extend Vim's functionality.
* A `maps.vim` file with all the keys mapped and custom shortcuts
<!--* A README.md file that explains how to install and use my personal Vim configuration.-->

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions or improvements for my personal Vim configuration, please let me know! I'd love to see how other people have tailored their text editors.
